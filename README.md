# TM1639a library

Arduino library for TM1639a chip use.

Library based on the TM1638 library made by dvarrel:
[dvarrel's TM1638 library](https://github.com/dvarrel/TM1638)

Just changed some values from that library to make it work with the TM1639a chip.

Also, I only tested the first 10 7-segment digits that the TM1639a is capable of control, because is what I needed.

Hope you find it useful!
