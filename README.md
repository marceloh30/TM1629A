# TM1639a library

Arduino library for TM1629a chip use.

Library based on the TM1638 library made by dvarrel:
[dvarrel's TM1638 library](https://github.com/dvarrel/TM1638)

Just changed some values from that library to make it work with the TM1629a chip.

Also, I've tested only the first 10 (of 16) 7-segment digits that TM1629a could control, because it was what I needed.

Hope you find it useful!
